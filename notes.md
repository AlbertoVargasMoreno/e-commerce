using vscode, is a great place to work, cause it shows you when are you misspelling, and if something doesn't have a definition.
at least at this point in React. If I need to develop something in React, I consider using React would be better, than staying with vim, cause.
  I'm likely to make a lot of errors.


if this is true then ; with and-and to show something if the first part is true
{ isthistrue === 1 && (
	somethingToDo
)}
